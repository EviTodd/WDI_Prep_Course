    <p class="box1"> The actual content inside is 200px wide. The Text is padded by 20px left and right, and 10px top and bottom. It has a dotted border 2px thick.

    <p class="box2">This box has the same exact CSS styles applied to it, the distance between the two boxes is 30px. Overlap between margin is a thing.
